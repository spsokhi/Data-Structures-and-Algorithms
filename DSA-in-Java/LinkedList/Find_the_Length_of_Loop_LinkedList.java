// Approach : Brute Force
/*
Algorithm / Intuition
Finding the length of the loop of a linked list is an extension of Detection of Loop so review that article and make
sure you are thorough with its approaches.

In recap, a loop in a linked list occurs when there is at least one node that, when used as a starting point, allows
 us to return to it during traversal.

Approach 1: Brute Force Hashing

While traversing the linked list, employ a timer against each node to keep track of the number of nodes you've visited
before it. Once a previously visited node is encountered again, the length of the loop can be determined by subtracting
the timer values at the two instances of visiting that particular node.

Hence it's important to keep track of nodes and the timer value associated with them. This can be implemented using a
hashmap with nodes as the key and the timer as the value.

Algorithm:
Step 1: Traverse through the LL using the traversal technique of assigning a temp node to the head and iterating by
moving to the next element till we reach null. While traversing, keep track of the Visited nodes and the timer value
associated in the map data structure.

Step 2: Continue traversing till a node that has already been visited is found. The difference between its timer
value in the hashmap and the current timers value will be the length of the linked list.

Step 3: If the traversal is completed, and we reach the last point of the linked list which is null, it means there
was no loop, hence we return false.

// Approach : Optimal Solution
/*
Approach 2: Tortoise and Hare Algorithm
The previous method uses O(N) additional memory. To enhance efficiency, the Tortoise and Hare Algorithm is introduced as an optimization.

The Tortoise and Hare approach has been discussed in this article.

Algorithm
Step 1: Initialise two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to the head of the linked list. `slow` will advance one step at a
time, while `fast` will advance two steps at a time. These pointers will move simultaneously.

Step 2: Traverse the linked list with the `slow` and `fast` pointers. While traversing, repeatedly move `slow` one
step and `fast` two steps at a time.

Step 3: Continue this traversal until one of the following conditions is met:

`fast` or `fast.next` reaches the end of the linked list (i.e., becomes null). In this case, there is no loop in
the linked list hence it is linear, and the algorithm terminates by returning 0.
`fast` and `slow` pointers meet at the same node. This indicates the presence of a loop in the linked list as we
have seen in the detection of loop.

This is the point where the slow and fast have met proving that there is a loop in the linked list. From here onwards
we start counting for the length of this loop.

Step 4: Initialise a counter with zero and traverse the linked list using the `fast` pointer again, but this time only
move one step at a time while incrementing the counter with each node visited. As the fast pointer reaches back at the
slow pointer, the value of the counter will represent the length of the loop.
