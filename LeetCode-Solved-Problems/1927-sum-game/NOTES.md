Question marks on the opposite sides cancel each out.
1 - We get rid of those "matching" question marks, so only one side will have them.
2 - You cannot decrease the sum, so a side with question marks must be smaller if Bob has a      chance to win.
3 - For two question marks on the same side, Bob can always make ? + ? == 9, regardless of      how Alice plays.
So, if we have n question marks, Bob can only win if smaller + n * 9 / 2 == larger.
​
Example: 456 : 6??: Bob can always making 456 : 609, 456 : 618 ... 456 : 690.
